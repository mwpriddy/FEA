	<h1>Abaqus Tutorials</h1>
	<p>The tutorials below have been crafted specifically for the Fundamentals of FEA class, but should be general enough for any interested user of Abaqus to follow.  These tutorials are student-generated, so please keep that in mind as you engage with this content.  The relevant Abaqus files (CAE, INP, ODB) are also available for working with and comparing to your own generated files.</p>
