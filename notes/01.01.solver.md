One of the major hurdles of solving these types of problems by hand (or with computer assistance) is the actual solution strategy for $Ku=f$ since you have unknowns on both sides of the equation ($k$ and $u$).  The standard methods for solving matrix systems (e.g., matrix inversion, LU decomposition, etc.) do not work with unknowns in both column vectors.  Below is an alternative method that can be employed.

From previous lectures, we know that each degree of freedom either has an unknown force $(f)$ or displacement $(u)$.  We can take advantage of this by grouping the unknowns together in the row format, such that...

The final matrix system will resemble:

$$  \begin{bmatrix} a & b  \\ c & d  \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} u_{unknown}  \\ u_{known}  \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} f_{known}  \\ f_{unknown}  \end{bmatrix} $$

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$

$K$ = global stiffness matrix
$u$ = global displacements
$f$ = global forces

In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$ for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$ divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$. The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
