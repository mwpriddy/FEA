One of the major hurdles of solving these types of problems by hand (or with computer assistance) is the actual solution strategy for $Ku=f$ since you have unknowns on both sides of the equation ($k$ and $u$).  The standard methods for solving matrix systems (e.g., matrix inversion, LU decomposition, etc.) do not work with unknowns in both column vectors.  Below is an alternative method that can be employed.

From previous lectures, we know that each degree of freedom either has an unknown force $(f)$ or displacement $(u)$.  We can take advantage of this by grouping the unknowns together in the row format, such that...

The final matrix system will resemble:

$$  \begin{bmatrix} K_{uu} & K_{uk}  \\ K_{ku} & K_{kk}  \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} u_{unknown}  \\ u_{known}  \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix} f_{known}  \\ f_{unknown} + f_{ext} \end{bmatrix} $$

In general terms, this matrix represents 2 equations and 2 unknowns.  The first equation can be written as:

$$  K_{uu}u_{unknown} + K_{uk}u_{known} = f_{known} $$

Therefore, the only unknown in this equation is $u_{unknown}$, which can be solved for with an inversion of $K_{uu}$ and moving terms to the RHS.

$$  u_{unknown} +  = K_{uu}^(-1)  \left( f_{known} - K_{uk}u_{known} \right) $$

The second equation can then be used to solve for $f_{unknown}$.

$$  K_{ku}u_{unknown} + K_{kk}u_{known} = f_{unknown} + f_{ext} $$

This only requires a reshuffling of terms. 

$$  f_{unknown} = K_{ku}u_{unknown} + K_{kk}u_{known} - f_{ext} $$

These steps can be performed by hand or with the assistance of computer software, including MS Excel.
